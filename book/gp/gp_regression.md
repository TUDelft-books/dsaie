# GPs for Regression

In order to use Gaussian Processes for regression, the first step is of course to observe some targets $\mbf{t}$. We again assume an observation model of the form:

$$
p(t\vert y) = \mathcal{N}\left(t\vert y(\mathbf{x}),\beta^{-1}\right)
$$(gprobservation)

which means that we observe $y$ only indirectly, polluted by a Gaussian noise with variance $\beta^{-1}$. With the usual *i.i.d.* assumption, we get that **conditioned on $y$**, individual target observations are independent from each other (*conditional independence*). 

Furthermore, we would also like to predict a new target value $\hat{t}$. With all this new information, we can adapt our graph model from before:

```{figure} ../figures/gpgraph4.svg

```

and following the joint distribution encoded by the graph (check this by hand!), we can arrive at a marginal for all our $N$ targets $\mbf{t}$ at (stacked) inputs $\mbf{X}$:

$$
p(\mbf{t}) = \displaystyle\int p(\mbf{t}\vert\mbf{y})p(\mbf{y})\,\mrm{d}\mbf{y} = \gauss\left(\mbf{t}\vert\mbf{0},K(\mbf{X},\mbf{X}) + \beta^{-1}\mbf{I}\right)
$$(gprmarginalt)

where we once again have simply followed the {ref}`standard result<bayes-stdexpressions>` for a Gaussian marginal under Bayesian inversion, in this case with $\bs{\Sigma} = K(\mbf{X},\mbf{X})$, $\mbf{A}=\mbf{I}$ and $\mbf{L}^{-1}=\beta^{-1}\mbf{I}$.

From Eq. {eq}`gpjointab` we have seen previously, we can now easily include $\hat{t}$ in the joint:

$$
p(\mbf{t},\cB{\hat{t}}) = 
\gauss\left(
\mbf{t},\cB{\hat{t}}\left\vert\right.\mbf{0},
\begin{bmatrix}
K\left(\mbf{X},\mbf{X}\right) + \beta^{-1}\mbf{I} &
\cE{K\left(\mbf{X},\hat{\bx}\right)} \\
\cA{K\left(\hat{\bx},\mbf{X}\right)} &
\cB{k\left(\hat{\bx},\hat{\bx}\right)} + \beta^{-1}
\end{bmatrix}
\right)
$$(gprjoint)

where you should pay special attention to what comes from $p(\mbf{y})$ and what comes from the observation model, namely the noise $\beta$. Finally, again using the {ref}`standard result<bayes-stdexpressions>` for multivariate Gaussians, we can condition $\hat{t}$ on $\mbf{t}$ and reach our **posterior predictive distribution**:

$$
p(\hat{t}\vert\mbf{t}) = \gauss\left(
\hat{t}\vert \hat{m},\hat{\sigma}^2
\right)
$$(gprposterior)

with posterior mean:

$$
\hat{m} = \cA{K\left(\hat{\bx},\mbf{X}\right)}
\left[
K\left(\mbf{X},\mbf{X}\right) + \beta^{-1}\mbf{I}
\right]^{-1}
\mbf{t}
$$(gprposteriormean)

and posterior variance:

$$
\hat{\sigma}^2 = \cB{k\left(\hat{\bx},\hat{\bx}\right)} - \cA{K\left(\hat{\bx},\mbf{X}\right)}
\left[
K\left(\mbf{X},\mbf{X}\right) + \beta^{-1}\mbf{I}
\right]^{-1}
\cE{K\left(\mbf{X},\hat{\bx}\right)} + \beta^{-1}
$$(gprposteriorvar)

and we can just as easily predict for multiple values of $\hat{t}$ at once by using a block $\hat{\bx}$, in which case the mean becomes a vector and the variance becomes a covariance matrix.

Look again at the expressions above: note how a GP for regression is a **non-parametric model**. Instead of storing information obtained during training in a weight vector, we always need the values of $\mbf{t}$ and $\mbf{X}$ to make new predictions.

Below you can see an example of GP model for regression for a one-dimensional input. We opt for a Squared Exponential kernel. On the left you can see the prior over $t$ (mean and two standard deviations) with draws from $y(x)$ also shown. On the right you can see the posterior over $\hat{t}$ for the whole domain including some draws from the posterior over functions $p(\mbf{y}\vert\mbf{t})$.

Note how all desirable features for a robust model are present:
- The model avoids overfitting even for very small datasets;
- Mean and sampled functions fit closely to the observed data;
- The variance gives a measure of prediction uncertainty, increasing away from the observations;
- Hyperparameters are learned directly from data without the need for a validation dataset.

In the next page we will go through this last point, namely how to determine suitable values for the kernel hyperparameters. 

Play with the interactive plot below to get some more intuition on GPs. You start with the prior and can sample anywhere to see how the posterior looks like. The GP prior/posterior is also being sampled on the fly so you can see how the samples look like:

```{admonition} Exam questions    
:class: danger    
Questions about GPs in the exam will mostly be about deeper concepts about the model than about numerical calculations. You should understand the formulation steps shown here but you will not be asked to reproduce them during the exam. It is however important to understand the concepts underlying every step.
